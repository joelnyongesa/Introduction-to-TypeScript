# Introduction to TypeScript

In this repo, I begin my journey using TypeScript, exploring basics which include:

* Built-in types
* The any type
* Arrays
* Tuples
* Enums
* Functions
* Objects

## Requirements

* Node JS
* TypeScript, installed using `npm i -g typescript`. You can check if you have TypeScipt installed using the command `tsc -v`

## Getting started

To contribute:

1. Simply fork and clone this repository to create a local copy on your machine
2. Navigate into this directory using your terminal/ cmd and compile the TypeScript code using `tsc`
3. Now run the emitted JavaScript file using `node dist/index.js`
